    "Programming is the process of creating a set of instructions that tell a computer how to perform a task. These instructions must be precise and unambiguous because computers execute them exactly as written—they cannot infer intent or fill in missing information.\n",
    "\n",
    "> 📖 **Definition:** A **program** (also called software or code) is a sequence of instructions written in a programming language that a computer can execute to perform a specific task or solve a problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike humans, computers are literal interpreters. If you provide incomplete or ambiguous instructions, the computer will either fail with an error or produce incorrect results. This fundamental characteristic shapes everything about how we write programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "> 💡 **Analogy: A Recipe**\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Consider baking a cake. A recipe provides step-by-step instructions:\n",
    "1. Preheat oven to 180°C\n",
    "2. Mix 200g flour with 150g sugar\n",
    "3. Add 2 eggs and 100ml milk\n",
    "4. Stir until smooth\n",
    "5. Pour into pan and bake for 30 minutes\n",
    "A program works similarly: it specifies exact operations in a specific order with specific data. Skip a step or change the order, and the result changes. A computer follows these instructions with perfect precision but zero understanding.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Stored-Program Concept\n",
    "\n",
    "Modern computers operate on the **stored-program concept**, developed by John von Neumann in the 1940s. This revolutionary idea means that both the program (instructions) and the data it operates on are stored in the same memory. Before this, \"programming\" a computer meant physically rewiring it.\n",
    "\n",
    "This concept enables the flexibility we take for granted today: the same physical computer can run a web browser, process spreadsheets, play games, or analyze scientific data—simply by loading different programs into memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Levels of Abstraction\n",
    "\n",
    "Computers fundamentally operate on **binary**—sequences of 0s and 1s representing electrical states (off/on). Writing programs directly in binary would be impractical, so we use layers of abstraction:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Machine Code:** Binary instructions the CPU directly executes\n",
    "- **Assembly Language:** Human-readable mnemonics that map to machine code\n",
    "- **High-Level Languages:** Python, Java, C++—closer to human language\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is a **high-level language**, meaning it abstracts away hardware details. When you write `print(\"Hello\")`, Python translates this into the many low-level operations required to display text on screen.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Learn Programming?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problem Decomposition:** Programming teaches you to break complex problems into smaller, solvable sub-problems. This analytical skill—known as *computational thinking*—is valuable in any field.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Automation:** Computers excel at repetitive tasks. A program can process millions of records, perform billions of calculations, or monitor systems continuously without fatigue or error.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Precision:** Programming requires clear definitions, careful handling of edge cases, and anticipation of errors. This discipline improves logical thinking.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Understanding Technology:** In an increasingly digital world, understanding how software works helps you make informed decisions about the technology you use daily.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Compilation vs. Interpretation\n",
    "\n",
    "High-level code must be translated to machine code. There are two primary approaches:\n",
    "\n",
    "> 📖 **Definition:** **Compilation** translates the entire program to machine code before execution, producing an executable file. **Interpretation** translates and executes code line-by-line at runtime.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is primarily an **interpreted language**. When you run a Python program, the Python interpreter reads your code, translates it to an intermediate form called bytecode, and executes it. This makes development faster (no compilation step) but execution somewhat slower than compiled languages like C++."
